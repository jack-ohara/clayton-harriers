Welcome to the new decade and the January 2020 Roundup.

We had sad news this month of the death of Michael O'Donnell. His running friend Alex Cran has paid tribute to Michael shared some wonderful memories ofÂ him below.

We have a new regular feature penned by a representative of the Committee explaining what they do. We look forward to hearing more from them in the following months.

The Roundup is nothing without the many contributions from our members. Please consider writing a report for your next race - maybe you could review the entire Cross Country season? All contributions, including photos where possible, should be sent to roundup@claytonlemoors.org.uk

As usual any omissions/errors, please let me know on the above email address.
