- 3 European Championships – Budapest 1966, Athens 1969 (Marathon Gold medal), Helsinki 1971 (Marathon Bronze medal)
- Commonwealth Games – Edinburgh 1970 (Marathon Gold medal)
- First British winner of the Boston Marathon (1970) breaking the course record by 3 minutes
- Marathon PB of 2.09.28.
- Took part in 115 Marathons, winning 21 of them.
- Ran at least one mile EVERY DAY for 52 years, 39 days.

Incredible!
