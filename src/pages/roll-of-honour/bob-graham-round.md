Clayton has a long and impressive history with the Bob Graham Round - dubbed the "classic challenge" by many.

All Bob Graham Rounds start and finish at the Moot Hall in Keswick, and must be completed within a continuous 24-hour period. The route covers a recognised list of 42 Lakeland peaks, and can be completed either clockwise or anti clockwise.

Total distance 66 miles (106 km) Total climb 26,900 feet (8.200 meters)

Bob Graham completed his round in June 1932, so it was 28 years before it was repeated by our own Alan Heaton.
