7.15pm - VENUE to be confirmed.

Due to Covid 19 the AGM is a few weeks later than usual. We are currently considering a venue suitable given current Covid regulations.

The Annual General Meeting (AGM) is your opportunity to influence how your club is run as well as ask questions or raise concerns.

At the AGM the committee post holders for the coming year are appointed together with the posts of President, Ladies’ Captain, Men’s Captain and Auditor. Any member can stand for a post subject to them being proposed and seconded by another member at least 14 days before the meeting. If you are interested in standing for a post and would like more information about what’s involved, please contact us.

The AGM also allows members to put forward proposals for consideration and voting. Proposals for the AGM must be seconded by another member and submitted in writing to me at least 14 days before the meeting.

Judith Carey, Secretary.
